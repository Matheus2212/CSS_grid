# CSS Custom 24 Collumns Grid
Simple light weight custom stylesheet for CSS grids. It is based on Bootstrap 3 (not flex display), but with a few add-ons. 

It uses a 24 collumns grid layout system.

Just insert it into your code as CSS using `<link src="path/to/file.css"/>` tag.

This still is being optimized.
